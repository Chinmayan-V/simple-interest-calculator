## Description
This project explains the concept of a Simple Interest Calculator.
Simple Interest is calculated based on the principal amount, rate of interest, and time period.

## Formula
Simple Interest (SI) is calculated using the formula:

SI = (P × R × T) / 100

Where:
- P = Principal amount
- R = Rate of interest
- T = Time (in years)

## Example
If:
- Principal = 10,000
- Rate = 5%
- Time = 2 years

Simple Interest = (10000 × 5 × 2) / 100 = 1000

## Use Case
Simple Interest calculators are commonly used in banking and finance to calculate interest on loans and deposits.
